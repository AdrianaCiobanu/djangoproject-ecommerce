This project is made by learning Django from 'Code with Mosh' course.

Beside refreshing my knowledge regarding Django, you will see implemented in this project features like:
Django Debug Tool, Relationships of Data Model. I've also played with one of the most powerful feature of Django, ORM - retrieving
objects, filtering objects, complex lookups using Q objects, referencing fields using F objects, sorting data, selecting fields to query,
deferring fields, selecting related objects, aggregating objects, annotating objects, calling database functions, grouping data,
working with expression wrappers, querying generic relationships, custom managers, queryset cache, creating, updating and deleting objects.

Admin Site authentication: selecting related objects, providing links to other pages, adding search to the list page, adding filtering
to the list page, creating custom actions, customizing forms, adding data validation, editing children using inlines and generic relations.
